## 1: Twin-engined Jetliners Dominate Air Travel

- In General, Twin-Engined Jetliners Are More Economical To Operate
  Than Four-engined Jetliners (Less Maintenance and Fuel Cost)

- Over Long Distances, The Latest Twin-Engined Airliners Fly The Farthest,
  Enabling Point-To-Point Direct Flights Between All Of The World's Major Cities

- Over Short Distances or Domestic Flights, More Flights Of Economical
  Small Twin-Engined Airliners Preferred Over Fewer Flights of Larger Airliners


## 2 Data Table Description

The Airliner Data Compares The Following

- Plane Model
- Maker (Airbus or Boeing)
- Number of Passengers
- Length (in meters, m)
- MTOW (metric ton)
- Fuel capacity (liters)
- Range (in km)
- Maximum Thrust per engine (kN)
